A few days ago I shared Contour — a CLI tool that spins up mock APIs from your OpenAPI spec. Since then, I've shipped the first stable release.

What's in v1.0.1:

> Smart data generation with matching field names to produce realistic values using FakerJs heuristics

> Request body validation and POST/PUT/PATCH payloads are validated against your schema

> x-contour extension tags control array sizes, per-route latency, and deterministic seeding directly in your spec

> Stateful CRUD implementation ensures stateful flag gives you in-memory POST → GET → DELETE without a database

> Chaos testing with error-rate and delay to simulate flaky backends

NPM: https://lnkd.in/dwqU6vqp
GitHub: https://lnkd.in/dW498xQA

Would appreciate your feedback — what features would make this more useful for your current workflow?

How Stateful Mode Works
Stateful mode uses an in-memory key-value store keyed by endpoint path. When you POST to /users, the response body gets stored in a Map. Subsequent GETs read from that Map, PUTs replace entries, and DELETEs remove them — so you get full CRUD behavior without a database. When the server stops, the state is gone.

It's basically a Map<string, Array<object>> that acts as a per-resource data store. Each route handler checks if stateful mode is on — if so, it reads/writes to the store instead of generating fresh data every time.


<!-- deployment workflow -->
1. pnpm pack --dry-run => to verify exactly what would be published
2. pnpm publish --dry-run => to verify exactly what would be published
3. pnpm publish => to publish
4. npm login          # if not already logged in
5. npm publish --otp=<your-otp-code>        # prepublishOnly will auto-run build + tests
6. Set the token directly in your project's
   .npmrc: echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_aqlpeOSnZm....." > ~/.npmrc
7. npm publish --access public

// Use the built-in npm version command to publish new changes
# Patch release (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) — bug fixes
npm version patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) — new features
npm version minor

# Major release (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) — breaking changes
npm version major

// Example
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add pagination support"
npm version minor          # bumps 1.0.0 → 1.1.0, commits, tags
npm publish --access public
git push && git push --tags
